        I wish I could make you feel the depth of my love for you.<br>
        Words will fail to show my eternal love for you.<br>
        You are my world, my everything.<br>
        Your smile lights up my world. You rule my heart;<br>
        you made my life amazing. I feel so happy and proud when<br> 
        I call you “mine.” Your love makes me feel alive.<br>
        I am not a possessive husband, but I won’t let anyone<br>
        stare at my girl for more than 0.001 seconds.<br>
        I cherish everything about you.<br>
        I never felt this way before the way I feel for you.<br>
        You are my love, my happiness, and my strength.<br>
        I want to spend the rest of my life holding your hands.<br>
